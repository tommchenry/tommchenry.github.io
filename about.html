        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an anti-social cartoonist and dabbler. I live in Chicago with my wife, Sara, and our two cats, Paisley and Boo Radley. Together Sara and I <a href="http://tshirtdiplomacy.com/collections/the-mchenrys">design t-shirts</a>. On my own, I design websites, video games, and a now-defunct free newspaper. I also keep a digital sketchbook that posts whenever I save any image I'm working on.
        </p><p>
        I have a BA and an MA from Purdue University and an MFA in Fiction from Warren Wilson College.

        In October 2015, I ran my fifth marathon. I like teaching myself other languages like Spanish, Latin and German. I'm a vegetarian, but I try not to be a snoot about it.
        </p><p>
        A quirky fact about me is that I was hospitalized for a week and almost lost my right hand from a cat scratch.
