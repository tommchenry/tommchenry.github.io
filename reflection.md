##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

>I already knew a fair amount about padding, borders and margin from doing my day job, so I already knew they can be a pain to tweak in order to get just right. I tinkered around with adding negative padding-left to an unordered list tag in order to try to get it to indent less, but I wound up not liking how that looked and getting rid of it. Also, I'm not 100 percent on whether or not adding negative paddings is best practices.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

>I learned that setting the `<footer>` to be fixed at the bottom of the window will cut off the bottom of the content of the `<main>` element because it will attempt to always overlap it. Then I figured out that I could add excess padding for the height of the footer to the bottom of `<main>` to compensate, and then the page will scroll as I intended and all the content is visible.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

>The easiest things to implement were the things like the navigation and footer. Adding link colors and then pseudoclasses so that the hover links also changed colors was very easy. Much more difficult was the good hour or so I sank into trying to fix what I thought was a padding problem that was pushing the text down in my header, when it was actually a vertical alignment problem (and that there is a CSS property to adjust this).

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge

>I learned that a number of elements don't vertically align to the top by default. I also got a better handle on using inline-block to have multiple block-level elements in a row in an area.
