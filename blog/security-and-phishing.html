      <h2>The Impossibility of Security</h2>
      <h3>Fear, Vanity and Phishing</h3>
      <h4>November 15, 2015</h4>
      <p>
      Total security is impossible. This is a terrifying truth that we have to make our peace with on some level to even sleep at night. If there's no window to be smashed, a lock can be picked, or a hole can be dug. Each new prototype of a perfect lock gets beaten by some new prototype of the perfect lockpick -- this is push and pull of the security industry. At a certain point, we simply compromise and accept a certain level of insecurity: we set the car alarm and lock the doors, we turn the deadbolt and set the chain lock and hope nobody just bulldozes down the wall. These things aren't perfect, but we have to hope we can inconvenience would-be thieves long enough that they'll take a different opportunity instead who didn't take quite so much care.

      As more and more people push more and more money through the Internet, it becomes a massive mostly insecure target of opportunity. Different developers working for different companies with large ranges of skills and security budgets mean that there are very few consistent standards to even build off of. And of course, once there are standards, would-be thieves can begin looking for standardized exploits. Here is the lock and lockpick problem all over again, but on a massive scale. It would be like if every bank was designing its own locks for its vaults from smaller locks (which themselves were built from smaller locks). Given enough time and enough incentive, those locks are going to be picked.

      But that's the hard way. It's much easier to exploit the biggest vulnerability of them all: the people who use the systems. People screw up. They leave their laptops unattended. They use the same password everywhere and it's something easy to remember like <code>password123</code>, or they use hard passwords and write them all down on a sticky note stuck to the monitor. They don't make time to do essential updates on their software, and they search scummy backwater websites for free stuff. Oh and they're all constantly vain and afraid.

      It's those last two flaws that make phishing scams still so effective even after most people have already been warned about them dozens of times for years. The open nature of HTML code means it's just as easy now to fake a site that looks like an actual site as it's ever been. But because even more of our lives are run through more and more sites, the potential for catching a even very savvy users in a trick for giving up their own information has only increased. Getting an e-mail that there's a problem with your account is scary, and and resetting information is a hassle, so your incentive is to rush to close your fear loop as quickly as possible. Fear makes you stupid.

      Similarly, vanity makes you stupid. The prospect of winning money, a prize, or even a coupon is very enticing. Here is an e-mail promising that you are special. To delete or ignore it is to rebuff your own vanity! To deny your own specialness! To unfollow your bliss!

      Even knowing all of this, people still fall for phishing scams because they're almost free to send. Once you've done the work of creating the e-mail, you can send it to thousands of possible targets instantly. Even if only one in those thousands responds, you invested almost nothing in exchange for real money. You don't have to fool 1,000 out of 1,000, you just have to fool one in that thousand. All it takes is 0.1% of the population to be feeling especially scared or vain on a given day and the problem will continue to perpetuate.
