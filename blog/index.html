<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  The process went pretty easily as there were only a few elements to the page and they were all pretty straightforward. It is a little more awkward to try to navigate telling someone what to draw and where than it is to help navigate with code.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  The wireframing made the HTML development section a cinch. I drove during this portion and it was really just a process of typing the text in order and wrapping it in the appropriate markup. I also think you can tell the page has a clear and organized hierarchy of elements even without any styling at this point.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  A good wireframe uses simple boxes and text to create the most basic page layout possible. We blocked out the page in boxes and labelled them accordingly.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  My pair reminded me that the actual page content could be wrapped in <article>. For some reason, I always think that <article> is <content> (which is not a real tag).
